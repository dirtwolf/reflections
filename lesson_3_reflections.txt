When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  Remote repositories are useful when using multiple computers, or when multiple people are working
  on the repo.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay 
up-to-date with your remote repository?

  So you don't get unexpected changes when you don't want them.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
  
  Forks create a copy of a remote repository on github.
  Clones create a copy of a remote or local repository on the local machine.
  Branches create a new head on an existing repository on the local machine.
