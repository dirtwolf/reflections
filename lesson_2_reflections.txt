What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

  Initializing creates the git dot files. You have to initialize before you can start committing.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

  The staging area shows which files will be changed in the next commit. It's useful to help decide which files to
  include in each commit.
